## Proposed architecture
| Scope        | Hostname       | Type        | Public | Connects to                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transparency | log-db         | RDS         | No     |                                               | RDS instance to use as a MYSQL hosted backend for the Trillian database and the personality database.                                                                              |
| Transparency | log-trillian   | EC2         | No     | log-db                                        | EC2 instance running Trillian as a system service. Needs a MYSQL connection string and a LOG_TREE_ID, passable at runtime.                                                         |
| Transparency | log-backend    | Lambda      | No     | log-db, log-trillian                          | Lambda that runs the Flask API that constitutes the Trillian personality. Need to access log-trillian via gRPC and log-db via MYSQL since it has its own database for consistency. |
| Transparency | log-api        | API Gateway | Yes    | log-backend                                   | API Gateway that provides the public access to log-personality.transparency.cat.                                                                                                   |
