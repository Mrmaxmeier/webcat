This folder just contains components no longer in use. Previously to using Sigsum, it was using a dedicated Trillian log server with a custom built-perosnality. I also wrote python bindings for Trillian that are available.

The infrastructure had been greatly simplified by not tunning its own transparency server, thus the whole Terraform setup is overkill for the current needs and is deperecated.
